# [fit] Social Polling
</br>
## @porterhaney

^ 
Thanks for coming out to my this demo and talk at IRE.  I am VERY excited to talk to a room full of reporters and people in the journalism.  We work with a lot of news and media companies, but it’s not every day that I get to see them all in one place.

^
I’m going to to split this talk into 3 parts today.  

^
First: I’d like to talk a bit about how the news industry is changing and why it’s important for polling to change along with it.

^
Second: I’m going to show you a bit about how Wedgies is approaching this new wave of polling, voting and data collection tools.

^
And, third: I’d like to show off a few examples of news and other organizations using wedgies with their readers and constituents.

^

# [fit] News consumption is changing 
# [fit] FAST
## And, will keep evolving

^ 
To talk a bit about how the news industry is changing and how that impacts how people are surveyed and polled:

^
How people read news has changed dramatically in the past 5 years, and will continue to change even more dramatically in the near future.

^ 
In the last 10 years it has moved from print, to digital, to mobile, to having to support all 3 of those consumption channels. Now a publisher is having to deliver the news to multiple channels at once and produce content for each of these.  Additionally readers will want to see content across all of these channels.

# [fit] News discovery is changing even 
# [fit] Faster
## There are now hundreds of discovery tools

^
how readers find content and consume news has changed - they’re now finding their news through aggregators, social media websites, social communities, email lists, private chat groups, 

^
there are hundreds of news discovery tools and communities where readers are discussing articles.

^ 
Social feeds have become a prominent source of traffic for publications.  In these platforms content is supreme, a publication doesn’t need a large individual following it if has exceptional content.  The content on these platforms is more important then the # of followers. 

^
It’s a new distribution for news that’s enabling content to spread more quickly, and giving publications more reach then they’ve ever had before.  This spread of content across social has driven publications to devote a lot of attention to optimizing it as a path to more readers.

---
# Communication with readers is changing, too
## It’s not just a physical paper anymore, its:
## Sites, Apps, Comments, Social Content, Photo Apps, Live Streaming Video

^ 
Publications are now communication with their readers across many channels at once, not just one.

---

# [fit] This requires journalists change 
# [fit] how they distribute their articles


Multiple headlines and calls to action

Varying sharable content by Social Network

Resources spent replying to reader comments

^
This drive to capture readers from social has changed how reporters are developing their content and what content they’re developing.  It may not be just a headline any more, but a call to action for Twitter and a separate call to action for Facebook.

# This is changing how readers discuss news too!

## On site comment threads, Facebook posts, Twitter threads is where readers discuss news.

^
Comments on social has become a 2 way street - not just readers commenting but publications and journalists chiming in too.

# What does this have to do with polling?

## Everything! Polling and voting is evolving with these changes to news communication and data collection tools.

^
We think of polling as a way for readers and broad audiences to express their opinions in a structured way.  This explosion of new digital communities and commentary has brought an unprecedented opportunity to allow readers to express their opinions and collect them on behalf of publications.

# [fit] Some background 

## Early polling by media companies was done in person or over the phone mostly to predict the outcome of elections

^
Known originally as straw polling it was used first to predict an elections, quickly there after the media started running polls to discern everything from elections to the stock market to sporting events finding more knowledge with a mass of voters then just individuals.

# Vote collection has changed over time: 
## IRL > Phones > Email > Social

^
Over time how you collect poll data has changed:

^
To run a successful poll you have to get a high response rate from a good sample of the target audience. The easiest way to do that is to ask people questions where they spend time.  They used to spend time at physical locations or on the phone, now they spend that time on the internet, your publications website, and social media.
___

# Collect votes where people are!
## And, where you’ve built an audience.

^
The important part here is that you can collect votes from where people are and where they spend their time.  Don’t try to move them to another platform to vote and don’t call them while they’re eating dinner at home.  Engaged them with a survey on your site or in your social channels.

# Las Vegas Review Journal
## Should Nevada legalize Uber?
### The Review Journal engaged their readers with polls about Uber’s potential roll out in Nevada.

There was a lot of false information flying around during this event. A strong taxi cab commission, and an even stronger Uber lobby was spreading a ton of info about the rules and regulations here.  The Review Journal wanted to be able to find out how Nevadan’s really felt about the issue.
